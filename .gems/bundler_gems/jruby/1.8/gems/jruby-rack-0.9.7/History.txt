== 0.9.6

- JRUBY_RACK-22: Ensure we call #close on the body per the Rack spec.
- Set jruby.management.enabled true when creating a runtime. JRuby 1.5
  will default this flag to false, but you probably still want JMX
  capability inside an appserver.
- Miscellaneous spec cleanup due to changes in JRuby 1.5

== 0.9.5

- Upgrade to Rack 1.0.0. However, if you supply Rack in your
  application (either via rubygems or by vendoring it), it will take
  precedence -- JRuby-Rack's bundled copy is only loaded as a
  fallback. This allows you to upgrade Rack without having to wait for
  a new JRuby-Rack release.
- Implement Rack-based java servlet session mechanism. You'll have to
  turn on java servlet sessions by setting
    ActionController::Base.session_store = :java_servlet_store
  in your config/initializers/session_store.rb.
- JRUBY_RACK-7: Implement a rewindable 'rack.input' shim between the
  servlet input stream and the Rack environment. Below a certain
  byte-size threshold, the input is entirely buffered in memory. Above
  the threshold, the input is written to a tempfile. The default
  threshold is 64k, and can be controlled by the system property
  'jruby.rack.request.size.threshold.bytes'.
- The previous non-rewindable input behavior can be re-instated by
  setting the system property 'jruby.rack.input.rewindable' to false.
  Despite being out of spec, environments such as Google AppEngine
  require this behavior because writing to a tempfile is not possible.
- JRUBY_RACK-4: deal with threading and to_io by assigning IO object
  to an instance variable instead of defining a singleton method on
  the metaclass/singleton class
- JRUBY_RACK-17: Fix SCRIPT_NAME/PATH_INFO in root context (Chris
  Read)
- JRUBY_RACK-10, JRUBY_RACK-15: Fix request channel read issue w/
  POSTs and multiparts (Michael Pitman, Lenny Marks)
- JRUBY_RACK-14: Override both Servlet service methods (Michael
  Pitman)

== 0.9.4

- PLEASE NOTE: Prior to 0.9.4, jruby-rack would try to use the java
  servlet session store by default. This caused more confusion than
  it's worth; so the default Rails cookie session store has been
  reinstated for this release.
- Upgrade bundled Rack version to 0.9.1
- Introduce RackLogger, defaults to log to servlet context but can be
  made to point to stdout by setting -Djruby.rack.logging=stdout (for
  Google AppEngine)
- Detect Rails 2.3 rack machinery and dispatch to it rather than the
  legacy CGI shim.
- TODO: Still missing a java servlet Rack::Session adapter for Rails
  2.3. Should have it for next release.
- Update example Rails application to Rails 2.3.2, include bits for
  deployment to Google AppEngine using Warbler.
- RackApplication-related core Java classes have been insulated from
  the servlet API, so that (parts of) JRuby-Rack can be used outside
  of a servlet container. If your application or library is coupled to
  these classes, you'll likely be broken with this release. See Nick
  for details.
- Fix TLD to be more compatible (Fred McHale).
- Switched main code repository to kenai.com. Github.com still
  available as a mirror and for forking.
- EXPERIMENTAL: Beginnings of a JMS API (more details to come)
- REMOVAL: All the goldspike compatibility bits have been removed. You
  should upgrade your application to use a web.xml similar to what
  comes with Warbler.

== 0.9.3

- Merb updates for 1.0 compatibility
- Patch race condition in runtime pooling that allowed more than max
  number of runtimes
- Fix bug with backref interpretation and windows paths
- JRUBY-2908: Add fallback for when servletContext.getRealPath doesn't
  work (Joern Hartmann)
- Add extra prevention to ensure that IO descriptor keys do not leak in
  the runtime's cache of descriptors (see also JRUBY-3185)
- Switched to dual rake/maven build process
- Switched main code repository to github (for now)

== 0.9.2

- Upgrade to Rack 0.4.0
- Only chdir at startup when the /WEB-INF directory exists (fix for jetty-rails)
- Fix typos in rails tag tld
- Add getRuntime to RackApplication for use by non-web embedded applications
- Use a shared application factory for Rails if max runtimes == 1 (to support multi-threaded Rails)
- Change from jruby.initial.runtimes to jruby.min.runtimes to be consistent w/ Warbler

== 0.9.1

- Change each runtime's notion of current directory to /WEB-INF, so you can do
  loads and requires relative to WEB-INF
- JRUBY-2507: Update Rails boot override to not pre-load action_controller
- Don't assume or set cache_template_loading to true, rely on Rails to do it for us
- Set ENV['HTTPS'] = 'on' for Rails depending on servlet request scheme (Lenny Marks)
- Fix request URI -- must include query string
- Updated to be built and tested against JRuby 1.1.3
- Ensure that gem environment is set up for plain rack apps too
- JRUBY-2594: Fix URI-escaping issue (e.g., when spaces are in the path)
- Make use of 'Rails.public_path' in Rails 2.1
- JRUBY-2620: Fix issue with non-string headers
- Support integer and date headers directly
- Examples: Rails updated to 2.1, Camping and Sinatra examples added/working

== 0.9

- First public release.
